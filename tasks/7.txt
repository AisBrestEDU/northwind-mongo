Create a query to return all employees and full name of person to whom this employee reports to:

| EmployeeId | FullName | ReportsTo |

Full Name - title of courtesy with full name.
Order data by first column.
Reports To - Full name. If the employee does not report to anybody leave "-" in the column.

db.employees.aggregate([
    {$lookup: {
            from: "employees",
            localField: "ReportsTo",
            foreignField: "EmployeeID",
            as: "inventory_docs"
        }
    },
    {$project:{
        _id:0,"EmployeeID":1,
        "FullName":{$concat:["$TitleOfCourtesy"," ","$FirstName"," ","$LastName"]},
         "Reports To":
         {$ifNull:[
         {$concat: [
         {$arrayElemAt: ["$inventory_docs.TitleOfCourtesy", 0]},
         " ",
         {$arrayElemAt: ["$inventory_docs.FirstName", 0]},
         " ",
         {$arrayElemAt: ["$inventory_docs.LastName", 0]}]},
         "-"]}
        }}
])

Create a query to return all employees and full name of person to whom this employee reports to:

| EmployeeId | FullName | ReportsTo |

Full Name - title of courtesy with full name.
Order data by first column.
Reports To - Full name. If the employee does not report to anybody leave "-" in the column.

db.employees.aggregate([
    {
        $lookup:
        {
            from: "employees",
            localField: "ReportsTo",
            foreignField: "EmployeeID",
            as: "employees_docs"
        }
    },
    {
        $project:
        {
            _id: 0, 
            EmployeeID: 1,
            FullName: { $concat: [ "$FirstName", " ", "$LastName" ]},
            ReportsTo: { $ifNull: 
                         [ 
                            { 
                            $concat: [ { $arrayElemAt: [ "$employees_docs.FirstName", 0 ] }, 
                                        " ", 
                                        { $arrayElemAt: [ "$employees_docs.LastName", 0 ] }] 
                            }, 
                            "-" 
                         ] 
                       }
        }
    }
])
